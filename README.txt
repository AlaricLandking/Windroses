Included are files to help you construct a wind rose.

You'll need access to LaTeX, and the packages csvsimple, tikz, xcolor, and pgf. If you don't have a preferred LaTeX program already, I recommend using Overleaf (online and free, but you need to set up an account).

The 'Windrose.xlsx' file is an Excel spreadsheet that will convert your data to the inputs required by LaTeX. You'll need to get your own data (such as through DECterm), and follow the instructions on the first page of the spreadsheet.

Upload the files 'main.tex', 'windroses.sty', 'oha.csv' and 'ohastorm.csv' to Overleaf.

The file 'main.tex' is the LaTeX command file that will create the windrose. The file 'windroses.sty' is the package required to run the above command file. The files 'oha.csv' and 'ohastorm.csv' contain the data required to construct a windrose for Ohakea Aerodrome; the 'main.tex' file is already set up to do this, so compile to check everything's working. You should get the picture in the 'Ohakea Windrose.pdf' file.

Feel free to use this for your own projects, just credit me for making your life easier :)
