% This package facilitates the construction of a windrose, and requires the packages tikz, xcolor, pgf and csvsimple to also be loaded.

% Inside a tikzpicture environment, the commands \background and \legend will set up a labelled degree circle and legend. The command \central, used as the final command in the environment, will create a white circle at the centre of the wind rose.

% The input for the windrose must be a .csv file, with headings "Direction, LightAir, Light, Gentle, Moderate, Fresh, Strong, NearGale, Gale". The Direction column must be the numbers 10-360, and each wind strength column must contain the percentage of the total number of observations that give a wind of that strength and direction, to two decimal places (e.g. 4.35% of all wind observations are 040 and Fresh).

% In the unlikely event that "Storm" is required, use the \spoke{\dir}{\rad}{\colour} command just after the \background and \legend commands in the main file, with \dir being degrees true (e.g. 30), \rad being 0.5 + ALL percentages from lower wind speeds in that direction, and \colour being darkpurple.
